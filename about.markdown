Hello, there. My name is Edgar, an engineer living in Taiwan.

My research topic during my school days is to detect the anomalies in the network behaviors collected from netflow data. This research replies on the AI model to help us figure out the anomalies. To make the expert the least needed in the detection engine (DE), we use the unsupervised learning algorithm to build the model. Most of the related researchs just stack the features along the time slots and feeds them to the model to distinguish the anomalies from the normals. So, we cluster the flow data with the time series of the features.

I've been working in ITRI and is responsible for the vitualization solutions (k8s), especially the design of the mechanisms for high availability (HA). I'm also maintaining a project about TSN scheduling. I'm currently new to a satellite routing protocol desigining project.

If you got interested in me, I'm glad to have you in contact:
